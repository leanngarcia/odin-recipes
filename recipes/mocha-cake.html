  <li>⅔ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
  <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9 inch round cake pans.</li>
  <li>
    Measure flour, sugar, cocoa, oil, eggs, buttermilk, baking powder, soda, and salt into a mixing bowl. Dissolve instant coffee in hot water, and
    add to mixing bowl. Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes until smooth; batter will be thin. Pour into prepared pans.

  <li>
    Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until an inserted wooden pick comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto racks to cool

  <li>
    Frost cooled cake with Coffee Icing. After frosting, melt some semisweet chocolate baking squares or chips in a double boiler. Drizzle chocolate
    around top outside edges letting it run down sides, or over top of cake.
